Want to become the creator of your own universe? This project allows you to control the fate of the universe by either concentrating or relaxing your mind.

The repo contains both the brainwave OSC broadcast program for Windows written by [Trent Brooks](https://github.com/trentbrooks/BrainWaveOSC) as well as the Big Bang simulation  sketch written in Processing, that I build on top.
